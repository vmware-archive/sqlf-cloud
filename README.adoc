= SQLF-Cloud

This project demonstrates the following,

. The ability to use SQLFire as your datastore.
. Data replication via the WAN gateway.
. More to come (Pulse, SQLFW, etc)

== Pre-requisites

. SQLFire 1.1.x installed on your machine path. This can be downloaded from the VMware/Pivotal website. Once installed verify you can access on the command line using sqlf command.

=== DB Directory 

The db directory contains host1 and host2. Each host directory is designed to run a SQLfire cluster instance (1 locator and 2 instances of SQLFire). Each instance can be local or running in different VMs/physical machines.

In each directory you'll find a set of bash shell scripts to configure, start and stop each SQLFire instance. Prior to starting the cluster please source the configure.sh script to set your environment variables. Read the description of each script below.  
  
=== Scripts
"config.sh" provides a number of default settings for your cluster. Only the Local_IP setting is required. Update it with your local IP address and source it before starting your cluster.
  
"start.sh" contains a number of SQLFire boot properties to make configuring your SQLF cluster easy. The license keys are defined in the script an a current license is required for Enterprise and WAN gateway for the functionality to work. License keys are available from Pivotal.
  
"setup.sql" configures the SQLFire cluster for WAN replication. Its run after you have connected to SQLfire using the following commands from a command
  prompt:
  
  sudo sqlf - sudo on Mac
  connect client 'local_IP:7773'
  run 'setup.sql' - assuming its your current directory otherwise provide path. 
  
"stop.sh" tears down your SQLFire cluster and removes the data directory. All data will be lost as this is designed to be temporary. If you prefer to keep the data, the logic for removal can be commented out.
  
 Assuming no errors your SQLFire cluster should replicate data Host1/Host2 and 
 Host2/Host1. You can test this by executing the following SQL statements
 
 insert into app.call_log values ('1234', 'test', 'test', 'test', '2013-12-12 11:11:11', 'test');
 select * from app.call_log;

=== Apps Direcotry
Contains a call center Spring MVC application used to enter data and display
 call entries. Import the application into STS using the existing maven project option
 (File->import->Maven->Existing Maven Project and browse to the location of the pom.xml
 file). 
 
 Open the src/main/resources folder and open the app.properties file. Change the data
 URL to point to your SQLFire Cluster and update the env.id to an appropriate location.
 This value is displayed on the Screen as the location. Build the application using 
 maven and deploy it in your local tcServer instance on STS.
